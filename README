Implementation of the Tracing Plane in Go.

This is a work in progress.  There is not currently integration with BDL (Baggage Definition Language), but the atom layer and baggage protocol are implemented.  This means you can propagate Baggage Contexts, but have to manually interpret their contents if you want to put or get data.
